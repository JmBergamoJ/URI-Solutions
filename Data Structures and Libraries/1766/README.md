# The Dark Elf
By Jean Bez, URI Online Judge BR Brazil
Timelimit: 2
The stable where the reindeers were was intentionally opened by the Dark Elf allowing each of them to run and fly freely around the Santa Claus' factory, causing the greatest disorder. The elves are desperately trying to do everything possible to let the sled ready for departure. You are responsible for putting each reindeer in its correct position so that it is captured by one of the other elves.



You know the stable follows an organization based on the order that the reindeers will occupy the sled. Thus, at the time of departure all of them can be easily positioned. Unlike what you may think, the reindeers are placed in a single queue ahead in the sled. Not all reindeers in the stable are used on each trip, that depends on the total load of the sled.

You got the list with all the characteristics that are used to determine the reindeer order. They must first be sorted by the descending order of weight. If two or more have the same weight they should be sorted in ascending order by age and height, if the tie still remains, order by name.

Using your last generation magical computer you want to write a program to order the reindeers according to informed characteristics and display only the exact number of reindeers that will be used by the sled (in an orderly manner).

## Input

This problem has several test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 105) that indicates the number of test cases that follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M (5 ≤ N, M ≤ 103) respectively indicating the total number of reindeers and the number of reindeers that will pull the sleigh. In the next lines it will be informed an string S followed by two integers W (1 ≤ W ≤ 300) and A (1 ≤ A ≤ 300) and a floating point number H (0.00 ≤ H ≤ 3.00), indicating the name, weight, age and height of each raindeer.

## Output

For each test case you should print the message "CENARIO {i}" where i indicates the current test case followed by the position and the name of each of the M reindeer that will pull the sleigh, ordered as described above.
