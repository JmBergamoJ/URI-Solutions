Somebody messed up the olympic medal table. Your program must put it back in the right order. The order of the countries in the medal table is given by the number of gold medals. If there's a tie in the number of gold medals, than the country with more silver medals win. If there's a tie in both gold and silver medals, the country with more bronze medals should be above. If two or more nations tie in the three kinds of medals, your program must show them in alphabetic order.
